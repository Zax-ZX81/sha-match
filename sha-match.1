.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsha-match\fR uses SHA256 checksums to identify files, cataloguing
collections of files (\fIdatasets\fR) for later searches.
\fIDataset\fR files can be compared to show files in common, or files
unique to one set.
.SS smatch
Compares two dataset files \- a \fIsearchlist\fR and a
\fIdatabase\fR, printing the filepaths of matching files from the
\fIsearchlist\fR to \fIstdout\fR.
\fB-d\fR and \fB-m\fR can be used in combination, \fB-i\fR
is exclusive.  \fBSMatch\fR - a simple bash script equivalent of \fBsmatch\fR is included.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-d\fR
Print matches from the \fIdatabase\fR.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-i\fR
Print the complement of the search - the files that \fBdon\[cq]t\fR
match.
This output is the full two or three field entries for the files from the \fIdatabase\fR
dataset.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-m\fR
Print all matches for a file if there are multiples.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-V\fR
Print version information.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-z\fR
Show matches with zero file size.  Suppressed by default.  Combine with \fB-m\fR to show all of them.
.SS sfind
This generates a dataset for the current directory, equivalent to 'find
-type f | sha256sum > dataset.sha256'.  \fBSFind\fR - a simple bash script equivalent of \fBsfind\fR is included.
The default output is a s2db file, but output matching
\fIsha256sum\fR is available.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-f\fR
Sort file by filepath.
Default is to sort by \fISHA256\fR.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-i\fR
\fBInclude\fR only entries in 'sf_filter' in file search.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-n\fR
Suppress progress in SHA256 generation phase.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-o\fR
Create two column \fIsha256sum\fR output.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-s\fR
Suppress most messages and print to stdout.
Don\[cq]t create an output file.
Default behaviour if no filename given.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-u\fR
Don\[cq]t sort output.
The sort is a simple bubble sort and very slow.
Large files are better to be sent to stdout and sorted through a command
line pipe.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-v\fR
Verbose.
Print lots of stuff.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-V\fR
Print version information.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-x\fR
\fBExclude\fR entries in 'sf_filter' from file search.
.PP
.SS supdate
This generates an update to an existing dataset for the current directory,
rather than re-calculating all SHA256SUMs from scratch.
By default it produces a report on changes without calculating checksums
or writing results to an s2db file.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-d\fR
Show which entries will be removed from the database by the update.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-f\fR
Force supdate to write the output file.  By default, if there are a lot of
changes (90+% files deleted or 10-% retained) supdate issues a warning and
suppresses writing the output file.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-i\fR
\fBInclude\fR only entries in 'sf_filter' in file search.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-U\fR
Write an updated database file.  Appends '-U' to existing database name.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-v\fR
Verbose.
Print lots of stuff.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-V\fR
Print version information.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-x\fR
\fBExclude\fR entries in 'sf_filter' from file search.
.PP
.SS sdup
Searches for duplicate files within a dataset.  By default it prints a report with the first duplicate in each set highlighted in yellow. The switches \fB-f -F -l -L\fR can be used to choose which combination of duplicates is printed.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-d\fR
Don\[cq]t print the dataset column.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-f\fR
Print \fBall but\fR the \fBfirst\fR duplicate in each set.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-F\fR
Print \fBonly\fR the \fBfirst\fR duplicate in each set.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-l\fR
Print \fBall but\fR the \fBlast\fR duplicate in each set
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-L\fR
Print \fBonly\fR the \fBlast\fR duplicate in each set.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-m\fR
Mark the first duplicate with a hash (#).  The default is to print it in yellow using ANSI colour codes that can interfere with output piped to another command.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-u\fR
Print all unique entries according to their SHA256SUMs in s2db format.  This will include all files with zero size if any are present.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-V\fR
Print version information.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-z\fR
Include files with zero file size.  Suppressed by default.
.SS scheck
\fIscheck\fR searches for a single file in a database.  If no database is specified,
the last verified database is used.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-d database-file\fR
Specify the database to search.  Databases should given with a full pathname to avoid 'not found' errors when the CWD changes.
.PP
.TP
.B \fB-V\fR
Print version information.
.PP
.SS sconvert
.PP
This converts a plain \fISHA256\fR file to a \fIs2db\fR file.
.PP
.SH FILES
.TP
.B sf_filter
File listing the names of files/directories to be included/excluded from the file search.
Can be generated with 'ls > sf_filter' and then edited as needed.
Any directories in \fBsf_filter\fR will include/exclude all items to maximum depth in that directory.
Files/directories multiple directories deep can be picked out, ie .cache/mozilla/firefox can be used to exclude the Firefox cache from a user directory.
.TP
.B ~/.scheck_db
File that stores the name of the last database file that \fIscheck\fR used sucessfully.
This database will be used until another is specified.
.TP
.B dataset.sha256
Two column (separated by two spaces) output from \fIsha256sum\fR.
.PP
.TP
.B dataset.s2db
Three column output, tab separated.
1: SHA256, 2: filepath, 3: dataset.
.PP
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
The sorts used in \fIsmatch\fR, \fIsfind\fR and \fIsupdate\fR are very basic and slow.  If you\[cq]re generating a large dataset with \fIsfind\fR you\[cq]d be better off
leaving the output unsorted and piping it to \fIsort (1)\fR.
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.PP
\fIsfind\fR and others uses popen() to get SHA256SUMs - from \fIsha256sum\fR in Linux and \fIcertutil\fR in Windows.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Doesn\[cq]t use zero-delimited file names, so is subject to errors caused by strange characters in file names, especially '\[ga]'.
.PP
Bash scripts \fBSFind\fR and \fBSMatch\fR - fallback versions of the binaries - are included in case of failures.
.SH COPYLEFT
.PP
If you want to steal this, I'll meet you in the carpark.
